# BIOL 7200 Programming for Bioinformatics

This repository contains the course materials for BIOL 7200 Programming for Bioinformatics. The first half of the semester covered Unix/Linux operations, utilities, and bash shell scripting. Python material along with some data science methodologies were introduced in the second half of the course.

Includes syllabus, informative readings, slides, Jupyter Notebooks, weekly homework assignments/exercises, and the final Magnum Opus project included in the Week 10 and Week 11.
