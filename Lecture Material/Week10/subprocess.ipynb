    "You can write code to perform many tasks in Python. However, it is much to use tools that someone else has already made instead of writing everything yourself. In a previous week, we covered how you can use Python packages and modules to use code written by yourself or others in any Python script. But what about when you want to run other command line applications outside of Python? In those cases you can use the Python module, \"subprocess\", to run those command line applications and store their output.\n",

    "[The subprocess module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) includes a range of functionality for creating and checking the output of processes. For this demonstration, we are going to stick with the basic functionality of `subprocess.run()`. There are other functions which provide more control and options, but `run()` is typically going to be all you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "`run()` takes a list of arguments as well as any optional settings you want to provide. It runs the command made by combining the provided arguments, waits for the command to finish executing, and then returns a class called `CompletedProcess` which has a range of attributes that allow you to interact with the output of the command.\n",
