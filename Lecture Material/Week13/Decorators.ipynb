    "# Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do decorators look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators are a feature of Python that allow you to modify the behaviour of functions and classes. Decorators in Python are typically written like: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@decorator\n",
    "def func():\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing decorators using and \"@\" symbol is what is called \"syntactic sugar\", which means that it is simply an alternative way of writing something. The `@decorator` syntax is easier to read, but the equivalent way to write the use of a decorator is perhaps better to understand what it is doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def func():\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "func = decorator(func)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As the second code snippet indicates, decorators are functions. They take as input a callable object (i.e., function or class), modify it in some way, and then return the modified form. The first form conceals that behaviour a bit in favour of it being more obvious that a function is being modified. Once you know how decorators work, the first form is much easier to follow. Furthermore, the second form requires you to write the function name three times, which is far too many.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do decorators work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators use a feature of Python that we haven't talked much about in this course - functions are essentially a kind of variable. Functions can be aliased by using an assignment operation and they can also be returned from other functions. Consider the following examples of those two processes in action using the built-in `print()` function."

In the example decorator above, the input to `wrapper_double_input()` is a single argument. However, many decorators are designed to work for a wide range of functions. In most cases, the authors of decorator functions won't know beforehand what inputs to expect. Instead, they would probably be best off blindly passing any and all inputs straight to the wrapped function. Indeed, that's what is typically done.

    "If, during last week's session on classes, or during this week's session, you have considered how you might apply classes to your own code, you might have wondered about how you could write `__init__()` methods that could handle different input formats. For example, perhaps you want to write a class that can handle genome features like those we used in several of the assignments in this class. To write such a class, you could reasonably expect to need to write code to handle the features being encoded in [BED](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1), [GFF](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format3), [GTF](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format4), [GBK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/samplerecord.html), or another format. One possibility is that you could write your `__init__()` function to take an argument that states the format to use. However, your `__init__()` would quickly become complex. An alternative approach is to use the `@classmethod` decorator to define a method for each different way you could want to make an instance of your class (e.g., one method for each distinct format in which genome features can be encoded).\n",
    "\n",
    "Staticmethods, which were described above, change the nature of methods, by removing `self` from the parameters of the method. Classmethods also make a large change to the way the method behaves. Specifically, classmethods don't take `self` as their first input, but instead take the class itself. Classmethods then return an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make use of a classmethod, you simply write a generic `__init__()` that will take all the inputs you will want to store as attributes in your class. All of the processing is going to be performed by the classmethod so the `__init__()` can simply take some arguments and then store those directly in attributes without further processing. Once you have written the `__init__()` you then write a method that takes some sort of input, extracts all the desired information, and then creates an instance of the class just like you would outside the class. An example of how that would look in a simple example using genomic features in BED format is as follows"

    "### `@property`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, consider a situation in which you want to control how a user can interact with an attribute in some way. An example of such a case could be one that sticks with the above example of genome features: you might want to have a public API (i.e., what a user sees) that uses a 1-base counting system like GFF format, but behind the scenes you might prefer to use 0-base counting as that is what Python uses. One solution to this situation could be to have a method to set the attribute (e.g., called `set_location`), which allows the user to provide a 1-base number that your class then converts to 0-base and stores. You could then have another method that performs the inverse operation (e.g., called `get_location`). This would work, but your user would have to remember two different methods to use to interact with the same attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, in such a case, you would probably be better off using a `@property`. What a `@property` does is essentially what I just described, except it does it behind the scenes and exposes a single attribute name to the user. Then, by using context clues about how the attribute is used (e.g., in an assignment operation vs as an argument in a function call) the `@property` decorator handles calling the appropriate method. The data would still be stored in an attribute of the class, and the `@property` method would simply access the attribute to set or retrieve the information. Typically such an attribute is treated as private (for use within the class only), which is indicated with a leading \"\\_\" character We could write a simple class that offers this 0-base to 1-base conversion using a `@property` as follows"

    "As you can see in the above code, the `@property` decorator is a bit different from other decorators that we've looked at because you need to call use it in a different way to decorate multiple methods and it changes name after the first method. There's not much to understand here; it's just how it's written, and so you just need to remember this syntax if you want to use properties. A bit of jargon that might help is that the first method you define, which you decorate with `@property`, is called the \"getter\" method. That's the one that retrieves that value. Once you have defined the \"getter\" method, that property is then referred to using the name of the getter method in future decorators. Additionally, you typically define a \"setter\" method to create or change the value. The \"setter\" method is decorated with a decorator that is the name of the getter function plus `.setter`. That identifies the decorated method as defining how the property should be set. Finally, you may also define a \"deleter\" method if you like. That method controls how the value should be deleted in case there is anything specific about how that should happen.\n",

    "In addition to examples where you might want to mdofiy values before storing or returning them, a couple of other cases in which you might want to use properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If it is computationally demanding to calculate something about your data, you could have a getter method that checks if the data have already been calculated and then calculate and store the data if not. This means you only expend that compute time if something asks for the data.\n",
    "2. If you want to create a read-only attribute then you can simply only define a getter method and not define a setter method. Then if anyone tries to use the property to change the stored value, they will get an error. Note that this isn't foolproof. The \"private\" attributes that start with \"\\_\" are not actually private. Anyone with access to your class can change them. Python doesn't prevent anyone from accessing anything in the code. Nothing is truly private. Instead, Python operates under a system where anyone changing private variables is free to do so, but is responsible for the consequences. Read-only attributes are therefore only encouragement to not change the value. They will stop people who are not familiar with Python, and will make other people pause to think about what they are doing and whether they should actually change the value."
