If we wanted to know what the function does and what classes we can use it with, we would need to read the code and figure it out. For this simple function, that isn't a difficult task. However, for functions that do anything more complicated than a line or two of code, it is worthwhile describing what the function is doing, what kinds of inputs it requires, and what outputs it produces.

That docstrings are stored as part of a function means you can use the Python built-in function `help()` to see the docstring and usage for a function. For example, our function `double_it()` has a help message that doesn't say much for now."

    "[The developers of Python have prescribed a recommended formatting style for docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/). There are also additional docstring styles. [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods) and [NumPy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) are commonly used styles. For personal use, you can choose your favourite. However, it is best to stick with one of the Google or NumPy formats as that is what other people (i.e., the readers of your docstrings) are likely to be familiar with. In addition, you can then take advantage of [tools like  Sphinx](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html), which can generate automatic documentation for your Python code. [There are also plugins for IDEs like VS Code that streamline docstring writing](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Doctrings use the multiline string triple quotes `\"\"\"`, even if you are only writing a single line docstring.\n",
    "2. If you are documenting a very simple function, (1 or 2 lines), you can use a single line docstring stating what the function does and what it returns\n",
    "3. Docstrings for longer functions still have the single line summary, but may also have a longer summary 2 lines below the first line (i.e., single line summary, then blank line, then longer summary)\n",
    "4. If your function takes arguments, describe them in an Args block. If you use type hints in the function definition, don't also include those here. If you don't use type hints, include those here.\n",
    "5. Whether or not your function returns something, incldue a \"return\" section. State simply what your function returns. Again, if you didn't put type hints in your function definition, put the return type here.\n",
    "6. If your function can raise exceptions, describe those here, including the type of exception and a brief description of the condition that causes the exception. We'll talk about exceptions later.\n",

    "In the above docstring, we are specifying the type of each object. Specifying the type is important so that people using your function know what to expect when they use it. As we saw above, we were able to call the `double_it()` function with either `int`, `str`, or `list` arguments. It ran and produced outputs in all three cases. However, in each case it behaved differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a system called duck typing (if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck). That means that Python doesn't explicitely check what type an object is. It simply attempts to perform the operations you write and then throws an error if any of them are unsupported. You will typically write functions that are designed to do something with a certain type. In many cases, if a function does work with an additional type, it will be by accident, and the result may not be what you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using type hints tells the user of your code exactly what functions were written to work with. They then know that if they use the stated types, they will see the described behaviour. Python doesn't enforce types when you use type hints, so a user could still give a different type as an argument, but any resulting behaviour of your code is their problem. You did all that can be asked of you by writing type hints. If someone were to post a GitHub issue on your code complaining that your function that takes `int`s doesn't work correctly when they give it `str`s, then you can reasonably ignore them and close the issue if you have documented the correct usage with type hints.\n",
    "\n",

One option is to output the entire `int` in one go and then end. After all, it's not really possible to separate out the digits meaningfully. A second option could be to return each digit as a representation of the value it contributes to the `int`. For example, 12 could be outputted as 10 and 2.

As with other classes we've looked at, what this means is that we can interact with this object in defined ways. Mostly, `generator` instances support operations related to looping. One such operation which will allow us to understand how our generator function works is the `next()` function. `next()` simply \"yields\" the next element in the sequence produced by the `generator`.
