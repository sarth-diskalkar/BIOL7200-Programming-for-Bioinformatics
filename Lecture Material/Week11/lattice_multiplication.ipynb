    "# Implementing lattice multiplication in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Lattice multiplication is an algorithm that (at least when I was in a child in England before readily available cell phones) is sometimes taught as an approach that can be used to multiply large numbers manually (i.e., in one's head or with pen and paper). Lattice multiplication is an algorithm that is fairly simple to use, especially when drawn out and seen. Here, we will implement the algorithm in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lattice multiplication algorithm steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can implement the algorithm in Python, we need to first identify the discrete steps of the algorithm and consider how each can be acheived. As discussed in the lecture slides, the steps of Lattice multiplication are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For two integers, N and M, construct a matrix of dimensions N by M, where each cell of the matrix is divided in two parts\n",
    "2. For each cell of the matrix, multiply the appropriate digit of N and M and store the result as two digits (i.e., if the result is less than 10, add a leading 0 to make it two digits)\n",
    "3. Sum the numbers along each diagonal of the matrix\n",
    "4. Working from right to left, process the sums. If any of the sums are greater than 10, carry the 1 by adding it to the value of the next sum\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see these steps at work if we go through an illustrated example. Let's work through the process to multiply 12 * 345.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a matrix is constructed of dimensions N by M. i.e., N columns and M rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![starting grid](images/empty_grid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we fill in each cell with the product of the corresponding digits of our two integers. If the product of the two digits is greater than 10, the digit corresponding to the number of \"tens\" goes in the upper half of the cell, while the \"ones\" digit goes in the lower half of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "![filled grid](images/filled_grid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the numbers along each diagonal are summed, starting with the bottom right corner and working right to left. When the result of an summing operation is greater than 10, the \"tens\" digit is carried to the following diagonal. That results in the following output for our grid\n",
    "\n",
    "![finished_gred](images/finished_grid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now work through the steps of the algorithm and write Python code to perform each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix construction\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must contruct our empty matrix. The matrix should have rows equal to the number of digits in one number and columns equal to the number of digits in the other number. It doesn't matter which number is used to determine each dimension. Let's use the first number to determine the number of rows and the second for columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the first step of constructing our matrix is to count digits in each number, we first need a way to get that information. We can use our iterint approach from the week when we covered functions. That looks something like this"

    "A matrix is simply a 2-dimensional array of elements. What that looks like in pure Python is typically a `list` of `list`s. You can think of the outer `list` as being the rows of the matrix and the inner `list` as the columns. For example, `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` would represent the matrix\n",

That will result in a `list` of `list`s of `list`s (i.e., a three-dimensional array). This is simply because we need to be able to refer to the first and second digit. We can't store the two digits as single `int` because `int` does not support indexing. Our three-dimensional array is really just going to be a two-dimensional matrix, where each cell contains two numbers.\n"
