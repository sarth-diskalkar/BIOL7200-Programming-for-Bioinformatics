However, we did not discuss a major feature of classes: their extensibility. In this notebook, we will cover creating subclasses to extend classes, i.e., create a copy of the base class with additional or modified behaviour. To explore subclasses, we will consider two scenarios:\n",

Now that we have our subclass of `int` we can go about customizing its behaviour exactly as if we were writing a class from scratch.

You can see [the docs for object here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object).\n",
    "2. The search proceeds from left to right through base classes if there are more than one. You can actually specify more than one base class when defining a class. Consider the example `NewClass(BaseA, BaseB):`.

If we tried this with one of the classes we wrote `__str__()` and `__repr__()` methods for in the last notebook, it wouldn't work as well as this.

However, at that point what was the point in subclassing `int` to begin with? For simple methods that's not going to be too much work, but I'm sure you can imagine cases where you might want to subclass a class that has complex methods which would be burdensome to rewrite. Luckily, there is a better way. Whenever you want to call a method defined in a class that your subclass inherits from, you can use a special function, `super()`. `super()` refers to classes from which your subclass inherits. Python will search as described above for any methods you name. Let's write a modification of the `__sub__()` method that is called when you use the subtract operation `-`.

    "## Writing Subclasses of Our Own Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing simple software, it will be common to encounter a situation in which you need custom functionality that inspires you to write a class. It will be less common for you to need to write multiple related classes. However, there will be times when something like that is called for. For example, in the last document We wrote a `BLASTResult` class to read in the output of a BLAST. We then added to it by writing some methods that were very much tailored to isPCR. In doing so, we no longer had a class that was generic to BLAST output. Perhaps a better approach would have been to write a generic class to read BLAST output, then subclass that to write specific classes which provide functionality for all the different analysis we might want to perform on our BLAST output. Perhaps one subclass would handle BLAST results for primers, while another could be tailored to BLAST results corresponding to protein domains for which we want to identify homologs. Both of those subclasses would need the basic functionality of reading in the fields of a BLAST output. However, each subclass would then need different methods for the analysis of the BLAST outputs. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you want to create multiple different objects with custom functionality AND those objects are going to have some overlap in their functionality, you should consider creating a base class that handles the overlapping functionality.\n",

However, to help to keep this as clear as possible, I'm going to use a simple example rather than reimplimenting something complicated like the `BLASTResult` class from the last notebook. Instead, lets create some classes for different shapes."
