    "# Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes in Python are definitions of types of objects. All objects in Python have a type or class (e.g., `str`, `int`, `list`), which determines how they behave, what they can store, and what you can do with them. We have spent some time discussing when you might need to use one class over another, and have sometimes had to convert our data between classes in order to perform a desired operation. In addition to using the built-in classes like `str`s, we can also define our own classes in order to create objects that behave exactly as we might like.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have probably noticed over the last few weeks of this course, you have been quite capable of writing sophisticate programs that can perform complex and useful analyses without the need to define custom classes. Indeed, with just built-in classes and the ability to define your own functions, you can do just about anything you could want to in Python. However, classes can make it easier to perform such complicated analyses. This Jupyter notebook is going to present some of the features of classes and what they can do. We will specifically focus on how the discussed features are useful. Hopefully, by the end of this document, anyone who has never seen a class before will have a good appreciation of why they might want to go to the effort of learning to use the.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by discussing two benefits that classes offer which make them worth adopting: \n",
    "1. Attributes - they allow you to pass around data in a clearer, more readable, and therefore less error-prone way.\n",
    "2. Methods - they allow you to write functions that are specifically tailored to the structure of your data in a way that makes it very clear the purpose of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interest of space, I won't add docstrings to all of the classes here, but just as with functions, docstrings should be used for classes whenever their function is not extremely obvious. Check out the [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#384-classes) and [NumPy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#documenting-classes) stylesheets for inspiration as to how you may wish to document your classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple use-case of a class is to simply store data in named fields. This sort of usage is very similar to how you might use a `dict`. Let's start by looking at a very simple class to introduce how classes can be made. Then we'll write a class that stores BLAST outputs and explore the benefits of classes by expanding the functionality of the class throughout this document."

    "For this simple case, the class and the `dict` approach to storing data in a way that can be retrieved by name is very similar. Perhaps the `dict` is even superior in this example as we could programmatically store any data with any key, as `dict` keys can be different types of variables, while class attributes are typically set and retrieved by name (although it is possible to retrieve class attributes using `str`s). However, while `dict`s are very flexible ways to store data, as soon as we want to store data of a consistent form and process it in a consistent way, classes start to show their use. Let's take a look at how we might write a class which will be used to store a consistent type of data.\n",

We'll create two `Person` instances and then just view all of their attributes with `vars()`. `vars()` is a bit like the function `dir()` that we used when covering packages and modules.

    "So what exactly happened when we ran the above code? Let's go through it step by step to explore how our class definition determined how we then interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class definition line\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, you may have noticed that in our class definition we started with the line\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "followed by no parentheses. This is in contrast to how that would have looked if `Person` were a function. That might have looked more like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def Person(param1, param2):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we created instances of our `Person` class, we *did* provide inputs just like we would have done for a function. What is the meaning of this difference in definition and usage syntax? There are two explanations for these syntactic differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, why did we not include parentheses containing parameters in our class definition? The reason for this is that parentheses in a class definition line do something else. We'll discuss this in another jupyter notebook when we talk about subclasses and inheritance. For now, a short answer is that when you define a class, you can copy an existing class to be the starting point for your new class. The copied class is what you put in the parentheses of a class definition line. If you are making a class completely from scratch then you don't need parentheses as all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, why *did* we use parentheses and provide arguments when creating an instace of our class? As our class definition didn't include the specification of expected parameters, how were the provided arguments used? To understand what heppened there, we need to briefly look behind the scenes at how Python handles the creation of a class instance. Specifically, what code it executes when creating the instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "[As described in the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__), when you create a new instance of a class (e.g., `gerty = Person(\"Gertrude\", 160, 43)`), Python runs a dunder method called `__new__()`, which is responsible for creating a new instance of the class. `__new__()` then looks to see if there is a `__init__()` method defined for the class. If a `__init__()` method is found, it is called with the newly created class instance as the first argument followed by any arguments that were given (\"Gertrude\", 160, and 43 in the gerty example). \n",
    "\n",
    "So when we provide arguments when we initialize a class, those arguments aren't used directly by the class, but are instead silently passed along to the methods `__new__()` and then `__init__()`. It is the `__init__()` method that ends up using the provided arguments as well as the newly created class instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `__init__()` method\n",
    "\n",
    "Within our `Person` class definition is an `__init__()` method definition. As described above, `__init__()` is used by Python to create your class instances. [The docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__) have a nice way of explaining how the two methods work together to create a class instance: Python uses \"`__new__()` to create it, and `__init__()` to customize it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "`__init__()` is what's called an \"instance method\", which means that it acts to change or otherwise interact with an instance of the class for which it was defined. We will look at using other instance methods below. `__init__()` is simply an instance method that is used directly by Python during the creation of your instance. As usual, you can recognize when something is going to be used directly by Python when it is surrounded by double underscores (double underscore is often abbreviated to \"dunder\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from having underscores around it and being referred to as a special type of function (an instance method), `__init__()` is very similar to the functions you have been writing. It takes some inputs and does stuff with them. In the case of `__init__()` and all other instance methods, the first parameter is always the instance of the class. In our `Person` class, `__init__()` also takes some other inputs, but that is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "What `__init__()` does with the provided inputs is typically use them in some way to set up the instance of the class. `__init__()` can do perform any operations your would normally be able to use in a function. You can use imported modules, built-ins, and locally defined functions and classes to modify the provided inputs or you can simply use the inputs as they were provided and assign them to attributes of your class instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the `__init__()` function, assignment to an attribute of the class instance is done using the `self` parameter. `self` is used not because it is a magic word, but simply because it is the parameter that points to the class instance in your memory. This is exactly the same as how you can use different names to refer to a variable within a function compared to outside the function. When you pass arguments to a function, those arguments are referred to within the function by whatever names were specified in the function definition line. Indeed, instance methods always take an implicit first argument of the instance that they are working with. By convention this first argument is referred to as `self` to make clear that the class instance is using its own attributes. However, as with other parameter names used within a function, any string of characters can be used for the parameter name. `self` is simply a convention that makes it clear to a reader of your code what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__init__()` doesn't return anything. Instead, it has made modifications to a mutable instance of the class and so those changes are reflected outside the function without the need to return anything. As `__init__()` accepted an argument with the specific instance it was supposed to modify, it only made changes to that one instance. We can see that reflected in the fact that `sally` and `paul` in the above example have different attributes to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, while we are only going to discuss a few, you can see all of the methods defined for a class using `dir()` just like we did to examine module contents previously. In the printed list of methods you can see the `__new__()` and `__init__()` methods described here as well as many more."

    "Note that we can do comparisons in either direction (i.e. `>` or `<`) and can check `!=` even though we did not define `__ne__()` (`!=`) did not define `__lt__()` (`<`) and `__le__()` (`<=`). That's because Python checks both the objects being compared to see if they have the appropriate method and simply inverts the result of `__eq__()` for `!=`. However, it's good practice to define them all if you need them. "
