    "## Writing scripts to be either run or imported\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw when importing `a`, the `print()` command in the script was run. Consider a situation in which you wrote a script that did a number of time consuming things, but also had some useful function definitions that you wanted to use elsewhere. You might want to be able to import the functions without executing the whole script. This is a common thing to want to do with Python scripts. In fact there are many situations in which you might want to be able to import a script without executing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do that by taking advantage of one of the special attributes that Python assigns to scripts and modules when they are executed or imported. Specifically, Python assigns each script a name according to how it is run or imported. The name of each script is stored in the special attribute \"\\_\\_name\\_\\_\". Special attributes like \"\\_\\_name\\_\\_\" are often referred to as \"dunder\" attributes as they have a double-underscore each side.\n",

    "\n",
    "The way we can use the \"\\_\\_name\\_\\_\" attribute is by checking if the script is the main script being executed or if it has been imported. Whenever a script is directly executed, it will be assigned the name \"\\_\\_main\\_\\_\". However, when a script is imported, it is given a differerent name such as the actual name of the script. Try it out yourself by making a script containing only the command `print(__name__)` and either executing the script or importing it into another script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that \"\\_\\_name\\_\\_\" will be \"\\_\\_main\\_\\_\" only when a script is executed, we can simply put any code we only want to run when executing a script behind an `if` check."
